# Hackathon IJML(It's Just Myself, Literally) - Weekend 1

Welcome to my hackathon project! This is a project for the first weekend of Hackathon IJML. The goal is to create a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework and a simple front-end interface using Vue.js. And yeah, I'm the only participant in this hackathon, so it's just myself, literally.

Feel free to join me if you want to ‚Äî just clone this repo, delete my code, and have fun! üöÄ

### Challenge Overview

The challenge is to create a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework and a simple front-end interface using Vue.js. The API should have CRUD operations for users, an endpoint for login, and authentication for the endpoints.

### Requirements:

- Develop CRUD for users (Create, List, Update, and Delete).
- Develop an endpoint for login.
- The user schema must contain the following fields: Name, Age, Email, Password, and User Types. Possible user types are ADMIN and CLIENT.
- Develop the process of authentication for the endpoints(Use JWT). Only the user registration and login endpoints should be public, the other endpoints should be protected.
- Document the endpoints (Postman or Insomnia) how to export, and add them to the project.
- Use PostgreSQL as the database.
- Use Docker to containerize the application.
- Develop a simple front-end interface using Vue.js to interact with the API.
- Add instructions on how to run the project.

### Must Have Endpoints:

- POST /signup
- POST /login
- GET /users
- POST /users
- PUT /users/:id
- DELETE /users/:id

### Payload:

Propose a payload you like. If you prefer, here are some examples:

GET /users

```json
{
    "message": "Users listed successfully!",
    "data": 
    [{
        "name": "Gabriel",
        "age": 19,
        "email": "gabriel@lspr.dev",
        "password": "162677a7c6abd2f3d37168b3",
        "isAdmin": false
    },
    {
        "name": "Admin",
        "age": null,
        "email": "admin@admin.com",
        "password": "429667a7u6cyd2f3d37112j8",
        "isAdmin": true
    }]
}
```
POST /users

```json
{
  "name": "Gabriel",
  "age": 19,
  "email": "gabriel@lspr.dev",
  "password": "qwerty123",
  "isAdmin": false
}
```
